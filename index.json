We studied the differences in PE and SC in broadband signals and their decomposition into frequency bands ( $δ$ , $þeta$ , $α$ and $β$ ), considering two modalities: (i) raw time series obtained from the magnetometers and (ii) a reconstruction into cortical sources or regions of interest (ROIs). We conducted our analyses at three levels: (i) at the group level we compared SC in each frequency band and modality between groups; (ii) at the individual level we compared how the [PE, SC] plane differs in each modality; and (iii) at the local level we explored differences in scalp and cortical space. We recovered classical results that considered only broadband signals and found a nontrivial pattern of alterations in each frequency band, showing that SC does not necessarily decrease in AD or MCI.","tags":["Alzheimer's disease","frequency bands","mild cognitive impairment","permutation entropy","regions of interest","statistical complexity"],"title":"Permutation Entropy and Statistical Complexity in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: An Analysis Based on Frequency Bands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.","tags":["Complex networks","Psychology and behaviour"],"title":"Defining a historic football team: Using Network Science to analyze Guardiola's F.C.

OS is calculated from the extraction of the ordinal patterns related to two time series, their transformation into D-dimensional ordinal vectors and the adequate quantification of their alignment. OS provides a fast and robust-to noise tool to assess synchronization without any implicit assumption about the distribution of data sets nor their dynamical properties, capturing in-phase and anti-phase synchronization. Furthermore, varying the length of the ordinal vectors required to compute OS it is possible to detect synchronization at different time scales. We test the performance of OS with data sets coming from unidirectionally coupled electronic Lorenz oscillators and brain imaging datasets obtained from magnetoencephalographic recordings, comparing the performance of OS with other classical metrics that quantify synchronization between dynamical systems.","tags":["Anti-phase synchronization","Brain imaging data sets.","In-phase synchronization","Nonlinear electronic circuits","Ordinal patterns","Synchronization"],"title":"Ordinal synchronization: Using ordinal patterns to capture interdependencies between time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539129600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539129600,"objectID":"b312bfb3e70b08843a01825b2f116dd6","permalink":"https://nachoenblanco.github.io/talk/bmu/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bmu/","section":"talk","summary":"Seminar on my thesis project to the receptor group in the BMU","tags":["talk","brain","multilayer","functional networks","cognitive decline","complexity","Alzheimer","ageing"],"title":"Complex Brain Networks: Multilayer Architecture and Cognitive Decline","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Javier M.

Alterations in community structure are associated with several clinical disorders, specially schizophrenia, although its time evolution is not clear yet. In the present work, we analyze fMRI functional networks of $65$ healthy subjects (HC) and $44$ patients of schizophrenia (SZ), $28$ of them in a chronic state (CR) of illness, and $16$ at early stage (ES). We find clear differences in edges' weights distribution, networks density, community structure consistency and robustness against edge removal. In comparison to healthy subjects, we found that networks from SZ patients exhibits wider weight distribution, larger overall connectivity, and are more consistent in the community structure across subjects. We also showed that the networks of SZ patients tend to be more robust to edge removal than healthy subjects, while having lower network density. In the case of early stages patients, we found that their networks exhibit topological features consistently in between the ones obtained from the other two groups, resulting in a tendency towards the chronic group state.","tags":null,"title":"Altered Modularity and Disproportional Integration in Functional Networks are Markers of Abnormal Brain Organization in Schizophrenia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Echegoyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"525395a369a2c02df28cb155b7377f74","permalink":"https://nachoenblanco.github.io/publication/nacho-m-sc/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T15:07:35.904267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nacho-m-sc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Brain Network’s Synchronization Measures: a statistical approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504483200,"objectID":"a650adbbec3232deb3dbf797f007a936","permalink":"https://nachoenblanco.github.io/talk/culagos/","publishdate":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/culagos/","section":"talk","summary":"Seminar on modern neuroscience and complex systems","tags":["talk","brain","neuroscience","complex systems"],"title":"¿Qué dice la ciencia de las redes sobre tu cerebro?","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504310400,"objectID":"288c8e55a1f0f1b0741e1271c10b309e","permalink":"https://nachoenblanco.github.io/talk/culagos_taller/","publishdate":"2017-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/culagos_taller/","section":"talk","summary":"20h hands-on tutorial with theory on functional brain networks for master's students in science and technology","tags":["talk","brain","neuroscience","complex systems","tutorial","MATLAB","functional networks","statistics"],"title":"Brain data analyses with network science: Practical applications","type":"talk"},{"authors":["María Prieto-Ursúa","Ignacio Echegoyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"92c587ddc983ded070ae28aaac3f9de6","permalink":"https://nachoenblanco.github.io/publication/prieto-ursua-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T15:07:37.064778Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prieto-ursua-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Forgiveness seeking","Self-acceptance","Self-forgiveness"],"title":"¿Perdón a uno mismo, autoaceptación o restauración intrapersonal?
